# Skill: clips — Planning and Records

clips is a local-first planning tool that mirrors goals and tasks to GitHub Issues. The current compatibility CLI stores planning events in `.clips/db/`; the target model keeps planning state external to the source repository. Repository records (CRs, ADRs, and FDRs) are committed under `docs/records/`.

## Triggers

- "create an issue", "track this work", "let's plan this", "write a goal"
- "break this down into tasks", "add tasks to the goal"
- "create a CR", "write a change record", "update the CR", "stack this CR"
- "write an ADR", "record this architectural decision", "update the ADR"
- "write an FDR", "record the feature behavior", "update the FDR"
- "what's the status?", "show me the issues", "what are we tracking?"
- "mark it done", "close that task", "update the status"
- "sync with github", "pull latest issues", "push to github"
- "set up clips", "initialize issue tracking"

## Conversational Workflows

These workflows are **mandatory**. When a user triggers goal creation, task breakdown, or task implementation, you MUST follow the multi-step conversation described below. Do NOT skip steps or collapse the workflow into a single response.

Use `ask_user` for every question. One question per turn. Never bundle questions.

### Creating a Goal

When the user wants to create a goal (gives you a title, says "let's plan this", "new goal", etc.):

**Step 1 — Acknowledge and clarify.** Take the title they gave you and ask 2–3 clarifying questions, one at a time. Focus on:
  - What problem this solves or what outcome they want
  - What the scope is (what's in, what's out)
  - Any constraints, dependencies, or context that matters

**Step 2 — Draft the goal description.** After you have enough context, write a 3–4 paragraph description of the problem/goal. This should read like a well-written GitHub Issue body:
  - Paragraph 1: The problem or motivation — why this work matters
  - Paragraph 2: What the solution looks like at a high level
  - Paragraph 3: Scope boundaries — what's included and what's explicitly not
  - Paragraph 4 (optional): Technical considerations, constraints, or open questions

Present this to the user and ask them to confirm, using `ask_user`: _"Does this capture the goal correctly, or would you like to change anything?"_

**Step 3 — Create the goal.** Once confirmed, run `clips goal create` with the title and the full description. Show the user the created goal reference (e.g. `#g001`).

**Step 4 — Offer task breakdown.** Ask: _"Would you like to break this down into tasks?"_ If yes, move to the Task Breakdown workflow. If no, you're done.

### Breaking Down into Tasks

When the user wants to add tasks (after goal creation, or "break this into tasks", "add tasks to g1"):

**Step 1 — Gather tasks.** Ask the user to list the tasks they have in mind. They may give you rough ideas, single words, or partial descriptions.

**Step 2 — Refine titles.** Take what they gave you and refine each into a clear, descriptive task title. Task titles should:
  - Be long enough to be self-explanatory (someone reading just the title should know what to do)
  - Be short enough to scan in a list (one line, no more than ~15 words)
  - Start with a verb when possible ("Add…", "Implement…", "Update…", "Remove…")
  - Not duplicate information already in the goal title

Present the refined list and ask the user to confirm or adjust, using `ask_user`.

**Step 3 — Create the tasks.** Once confirmed, run `clips task create-batch` with the final titles. Show the result.

**Step 4 — Offer continuation.** Ask if they want to add more tasks or if the breakdown is complete.

### Implementing a Task

When the user asks to implement a task (e.g. "work on t1", "implement the next task", "let's do g1 t2"):

**Step 1 — Recontextualize.** Before writing any code, gather context silently (don't narrate each step to the user, just do it):
  1. Run `clips view` to get the current state of all goals and tasks
  2. Run `git --no-pager log --oneline -10` to see recent commits
  3. Check the relevant files in the repo that the task will touch
  4. Review which tasks are already closed to understand what's been done

**Step 2 — Pad out the plan.** Based on the context gathered, write a brief implementation plan for this specific task: what files to touch, what changes to make, what order to do them in. Present this to the user and confirm before proceeding.

**Step 3 — Execute.** Implement the task. When done, run `clips task status <goal> <task> closed` to mark it complete.

**Step 4 — Next task.** After completing the task, show the updated goal status with `clips view <goal>` and ask if they want to continue with the next task.

### Creating or Updating Repository Records

Use these rules whenever the user asks for a CR, ADR, FDR, or asks to document repository work:

1. Determine the record type from the requested outcome. A CR records a repository change; an ADR records a durable cross-cutting architectural decision; an FDR records durable current user-visible behavior and feature rationale.
2. Do not create a new ADR or FDR merely because a task or CR exists. Update an existing record when it still describes the decision or behavior. Small bug fixes and feature iterations normally need only a CR.
3. Every non-trivial, reviewable repository diff gets exactly one active CR. A CR may cover one task, several tasks, or a complete small goal. It is not a child item of a goal or task.
4. Create or update records in `docs/records/` and commit them with the repository change. Do not commit goals or tasks as source-repository records.
5. For a stacked CR, set `Parent CR` and record the exact Git basis. Do not create a separate stack record.

When a repository change starts, create the CR as `Draft`. When implementation and verification are complete, update it to `In Review`. Only a human may manufacture explicitly human-owned approval states such as `Testing`, `Needs Changes`, and `Ready to Merge`.

Use the following canonical templates. Preserve the field names and section order unless the user asks for a variant.

#### Goal template

Goals are external planning artifacts and are not committed to the source repository.

```md
# Goal: Outcome title

**Status:** open | in_progress | closed | not_planned | duplicate

## Outcome

What outcome should exist when this goal is complete?

## Problem and context

Why is this work needed?

## Scope

What is included and explicitly excluded?

## Acceptance criteria

- Observable condition that proves the outcome exists.

## Constraints and dependencies

Known limits, dependencies, or unresolved questions.
```

For the current CLI, map the goal to `clips goal create` with `title`, `description`, and `acceptance_criteria`. Keep the description concise enough to serve as the planning brief.

#### Task template

Tasks are external planning artifacts associated with a goal.

```md
- [ ] Task title beginning with a verb
  - Goal: #g001
  - Outcome: What this task produces.
  - Done when: Observable completion condition.
  - Dependencies: Other task or external dependency, or None.
```

For the current CLI, create the task with `title` and optional `description` under the goal. Do not turn each task into a CR unless it produces a repository diff; one CR may cover multiple tasks.

#### CR template

CRs are committed under `docs/records/cr/CR-NNN-short-title.md`.

```md
# CR-NNN: Change title

**Status:** Draft | In Review | Accepted | Merged | Rejected | Abandoned
**Type:** Feature | Bugfix | Maintenance | Documentation
**Branch:** exact-worker-branch
**Base branch:** main
**Base commit:** FULL_COMMIT_ID
**Parent CR:** CR-NNN | None
**Covers:** #g001, #g001#t1 | Untracked

## Why

## What changed

## Behavior

## Files changed

| File | Semantic role |
|---|---|
| `path/to/file` | Role |

## Test plan

- [ ] Exact command and result

## Compatibility and operations

## Documentation and records

List ADRs/FDRs created or updated, or `None`.

## Review

- [ ] Changed files inspected
- [ ] Regression coverage reviewed
- [ ] CR branch and base verified
- [ ] Stacked dependency reviewed, if applicable
- [ ] Ready to merge
```

`Parent CR` expresses a stacked review dependency, not a planning hierarchy. The branch, base branch, and base commit must describe the exact change being reviewed.

#### ADR template

ADRs are committed under `docs/records/adr/ADR-NNN-short-title.md`. Create one only for a durable architectural decision.

```md
# ADR-NNN: Decision title

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Retired
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision basis:** FULL_COMMIT_ID
**Supersedes:** ADR-NNN | None

## Context

## Decision

## Consequences

## Related

CRs, FDRs, goals, tasks, or external references.
```

#### FDR template

FDRs are committed under `docs/records/fdr/FDR-NNN-short-title.md`. Create one only for durable current user-visible behavior or feature rationale.

```md
# FDR-NNN: Feature or behavior

**Status:** Proposed | Active | Experimental | Retired
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Behavior commit:** FULL_COMMIT_ID
**Supersedes:** FDR-NNN | None

## Overview

## Behavior

## Design decisions

## Related

CRs, ADRs, goals, tasks, or external references.

## Open questions
```

Do not create an FDR for a small bug fix when an existing FDR remains accurate. Update the existing FDR through the CR when behavior changes but the feature record remains the right document.

---

## Concepts

**Goals** are top-level planning items, optionally mirrored as GitHub Issues. Each goal has a title, description, status, and tasks.

**Tasks** are actionable planning items within a goal. They appear as markdown checkboxes in the GitHub Issue mirror. With `tasks_as_issues: true`, tasks become their own GitHub Issues.

**Refs** identify goals and tasks: `#g001`, `#g001#t1`, or shorthand `g1`, `g1 t1`.

**Statuses** mirror GitHub: `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`, `not_planned`, `duplicate`.

**Record boundary**: Goals and tasks are planning state. Every non-trivial repository diff gets one committed CR. ADRs record durable architectural decisions; FDRs record durable user-visible behavior. A CR can cover one task, several tasks, or a small complete goal, and may update an existing ADR/FDR.

**CR basis**: Every CR records `Branch`, `Base branch`, `Base commit`, and optional `Parent CR`. `Parent CR` expresses a stacked review dependency; it is not a task hierarchy.

## Commands

### `clips init`

Set up clips in the current repo. Creates `.clips/` directory, detects GitHub settings, and imports all existing GitHub Issues as goals.

**When to use:** First time using clips in a repo, or when a repo has existing GitHub Issues you want to track locally.

**Triggers:** "set up clips", "initialize tracking", "start using clips", "import issues"

```bash
clips init
```

---

### `clips view`

Display goals and tasks in a human-readable terminal format with status icons (🟢 open, 🟠 in_progress, 🟣 closed, ⚪ not_planned/duplicate).

**When to use:** To see what's being tracked, check progress, review task lists before making changes.

**Triggers:** "show issues", "what are we working on", "list goals", "show progress", "what's open", "view tasks"

```bash
clips view                  # List all goals with tasks
clips view #g001            # View a specific goal with details
clips view #g001#t1         # View a specific task
clips view all              # Include hidden statuses
clips view --all-users      # Show all users' goals
```

---

### `clips goal create`

Create a new goal (top-level planning item). The current compatibility CLI may create or update a GitHub Issue mirror.

**When to use:** Starting new work, planning a feature, tracking a bug, defining a milestone.

**Triggers:** "create a goal", "new issue", "let's track this", "plan a feature", "write up this work"

```bash
clips goal create '{"title":"Add authentication"}'
clips goal create '{"title":"Fix login bug","description":"Users get 500 on /login"}'
```

The JSON accepts: `title` (required), `description`, `acceptance_criteria` (array of strings).

---

### `clips goal status`

Change a goal's status. Automatically closes/reopens the GitHub Issue.

**When to use:** When work begins, completes, or is cancelled.

**Triggers:** "start working on", "mark as done", "close the goal", "this is a duplicate", "won't fix"

```bash
clips goal status g1 in_progress    # Work started
clips goal status g1 closed         # Completed
clips goal status g1 not_planned    # Won't do
clips goal status g1 duplicate      # Duplicate of another
clips goal status g1 open           # Reopen
```

Valid statuses: `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`, `not_planned`, `duplicate`.

---

### `clips goal update`

Update a goal's title, description, or acceptance criteria. Pushes changes to the GitHub Issue.

**When to use:** Refining scope, correcting a title, adding details after creation.

**Triggers:** "update the goal", "change the title", "edit the description", "add acceptance criteria"

```bash
clips goal update g1 '{"title":"New title"}'
clips goal update g1 '{"description":"Updated scope description"}'
clips goal update g1 '{"acceptance_criteria":["Users can login","Users can logout"]}'
```

---

### `clips task create`

Add a single task to a goal. Updates the GitHub Issue body with a new checkbox.

**When to use:** Adding one task to an existing goal.

**Triggers:** "add a task", "one more thing to do"

```bash
clips task create g001 '{"title":"Write unit tests"}'
clips task create g001 '{"title":"Update docs","description":"Add API reference"}'
```

---

### `clips task create-batch`

Add multiple tasks to a goal at once. Supports JSON argument or `--stdin` for piped input.

**When to use:** Breaking a goal down into tasks, planning implementation steps, decomposing work.

**Triggers:** "break this down", "add tasks", "decompose into steps", "plan the tasks", "create a task list"

```bash
clips task create-batch g001 '[{"title":"Design schema"},{"title":"Write migrations"},{"title":"Add API endpoints"}]'

# Or pipe from stdin (avoids shell escaping)
echo '[{"title":"Task 1"},{"title":"Task 2"}]' | clips task create-batch g001 --stdin
```

---

### `clips task status`

Change a task's status. Updates the checkbox in the GitHub Issue body.

**When to use:** Marking a task as started, done, or cancelled.

**Triggers:** "mark task done", "complete this task", "close the task", "start working on task", "skip this task"

```bash
clips task status g1 t1 closed          # Task complete
clips task status g1 t1 in_progress     # Working on it
clips task status #g001#t1 not_planned  # Won't do
clips task status g1 t1 open            # Reopen
```

Flexible ID formats: `g1 t1`, `g001 t01`, `#g001#t1` all work.

---

### `clips task update`

Update a task's title or description.

**When to use:** Correcting a task name, adding implementation details.

**Triggers:** "rename the task", "update task description", "edit task"

```bash
clips task update g001 t01 '{"title":"Renamed task"}'
clips task update g1 t1 '{"description":"Added details"}'
```

---

### `clips task reorder`

Reorder tasks within a goal. Only works when the goal is `open` and no tasks have been started.

**When to use:** Prioritizing tasks, changing implementation order.

**Triggers:** "reorder tasks", "change task order", "prioritize", "rearrange tasks"

```bash
clips task reorder g001 '["t03","t01","t02"]'
```

---

### `clips sync`

Bidirectional sync between local JSONL and GitHub Issues. Pulls new/updated issues from GitHub, pushes local changes. Idempotent — safe to run anytime.

**When to use:** After external changes on GitHub (someone edited an issue in the UI), to ensure local and remote are consistent, or as a periodic reconciliation.

**Triggers:** "sync issues", "pull from github", "push to github", "reconcile", "refresh issues", "update from remote"

```bash
clips sync              # Sync all goals ↔ GitHub Issues
clips sync #g001        # Sync a specific goal
clips sync g12          # Shorthand
```

---

### `clips config`

View or change clips configuration.

**When to use:** Checking current settings or enabling sub-issues for tasks. The legacy `auto_commit` setting does not change the repository-record boundary.

**Triggers:** "show config", "change settings", "enable sub-issues"

```bash
clips config                            # Show all config
clips config tasks_as_issues            # Show specific key
clips config tasks_as_issues true       # Enable task sub-issues
clips config collaboration false        # Solo mode (no git sync)
```

**Config keys:**
- `default_branch` — Git branch (default: `main`)
- `username` — GitHub username
- `collaboration` — Enable GitHub pull/push during init, sync, and goal/task mutations (default: `true`)
- `auto_commit` — Legacy compatibility setting; planning state should move to the external workflow store
- `tasks_as_issues` — Create tasks as separate GitHub Issues (default: `false`)
- `agent_dir` — Agent directory name for skill file (auto-detected; e.g. `.agents`, `.claude`, `.github`)

---

## Data Storage

```
.clips/
  clips.config.json       # Configuration
  db/
    g001.jsonl            # Goal g001 + its tasks (append-only events)
    g002.jsonl            # Goal g002 + its tasks
```

Each `.jsonl` file is an append-only event log. State is computed by replaying events. Files are never overwritten.

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Initialize in a repo
clips init

# 2. Create a goal
clips goal create '{"title":"Add user authentication"}'
# → Creates goal g001, GitHub Issue #1

# 3. Break into tasks
clips task create-batch g001 '[
  {"title":"Design auth schema"},
  {"title":"Implement JWT middleware"},
  {"title":"Add login/logout endpoints"},
  {"title":"Write integration tests"}
]'
# → Updates Issue #1 body with checkboxes

# 4. Work through tasks
clips task status g1 t1 in_progress
clips task status g1 t1 closed
clips task status g1 t2 in_progress

# 5. Check progress
clips view #g001

# 6. Complete the goal
clips goal status g1 closed
# → Closes Issue #1
```
